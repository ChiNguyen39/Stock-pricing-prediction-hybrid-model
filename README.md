# 'Hybrid' model to predict stock pricing
### Project goals:
There are 3 main questions need to be answered:
<li>How well machine learning can help to predict stock pricing?</li>
<li>How feature selection medthod may affect model performance?</li>
<li>How the "hybrid" model can be better than normal LSTM model?</li>
<br>So, I develop LSTM models and a "hybrid" model to predict Nike stock to find the answers</br>

### File structure:
<b>Data files: 2 datasets about Nike stock</b> <br>
<b>Ipynb working file:</b>
<li>collect_data_manual.ipynb: to collect, consolidate, clean data, feature selection.</li>
<li>hybrid_model.ipynb: data preprocessing, LSTM models, hybrid model.</li>
<b>Presentation:</b>
